senior secondary schools in Bauchi State Nigeria. The objectives of the study were to determine 
relationship between promotion, salary package, provision of teaching and learning materials 
and teachers' job performance in public senior secondary schools in Bauchi State. Three null 
hypotheses were formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance. Correlational research 
design was adopted for the study.  Simple random sampling technique was used to select a sample 
of 939 teachers out of the total population of 18,775 teachers in 288 public senior secondary 
schools. Structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The instrument was validated 
and pilot tested. The validity and reliability indices yielded a coefficient of 0.75 and 0.77. Data 
collected was analysed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r). The findings 
of the study revealed that there is significant relationship between promotion, salary package, 
provision of teaching and learning materials and teachers' job performance in public senior 
secondary schools in Bauchi State Nigeria. Based on the findings of the study, it was 
recommended that: Bauchi State Government should ensure that public senior secondary school 
teachers are promoted on time and that their financial benefits are implemented as promised. 
This will motivate them to efficiently discharge their assigned responsibilities; Bauchi State 
Government should improve the salary packages for public senior secondary school teachers to 
encourage them to embrace teaching as a preferred profession and to enhance their performance 
towards achieving the desired outcomes; Bauchi State Government should provide adequate 
teaching and learning materials to enable teachers to deliver qualitative education in the schools.","/app/uploads/460241c0245c4b989ae3bd71746e33b1.pdf","Funai journal1.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:38:49.429159",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"
"6","EMPOWERING FUTURE STEM TEACHERS: ASSESSING THEIR  KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE","Adaora Phina Anudu, Christiana Ogonna Odimkpa, Oby Justina Mbamalu  and Nkechi Tina Ebokaiwe","The study assessed the knowledge and attitude of STEM teachers towards artificial 
intelligence. The area of study was South Eastern region of Nigeria. The design of the 
study was descriptive survey. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the 
study. 120 STEM teachers who responded to online questionnaire formed the sample for 
the study. The instrument used for data collection was validated STEM Teachers’ 
knowledge and Attitude towards Artificial Intelligence Questionnaire (STEMTKAAIQ, r 
= 0.86). The research questions were answered using mean and standard deviation while 
independent sample t-test was used to test hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. It was 
found that STEM teachers have good understanding and positive attitude towards 
artificial intelligence. It was also discovered that there is no significant difference 
between tertiary and secondary STEM teachers’ knowledge and attitude towards 
artificial intelligence. Based on the findings, the inclusion and use of artificial 
intelligence in tertiary and secondary STEM education is recommended.","/app/uploads/0ab45fa98caa4fbe85949ffaa053f1cb.pdf","funai journal2.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:41:15.900001",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"
"7","ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH EDUCATIONAL  MANAGEMENT: STRATEGIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR NIGERIA","David Onyeamaechi Ekeh, Obodo Abigail Chikaodinaka, Chisom Anyior  and George Favoured Helen","The insecurity situation in Nigeria has reached alarming levels, posing significant 
challenges for both the government and its citizens. It is evident that government efforts 
alone are insufficient to ensure adequate security and sustainable development for the 
population. Higher education can play a crucial role in addressing these security 
challenges and fostering sustainable development in the country. This paper aims to 
investigate how education can contribute to improving security and sustainable 
development in Nigeria by identifying and addressing various causes and sources of 
insecurity. Educational management is identified as pivotal in guiding educational 
institutions to produce high-quality graduates who can positively impact society. 
Effective management involves ensuring proper resource allocation, combating 
corruption, promoting good leadership, and enhancing facilities within educational 
institutions. The study finds that mismanagement of the education system, particularly 
issues like resource misallocation and corruption, hampers national development in 
Nigeria. As a solution, the paper recommends that educational managers in Nigeria 
prioritize effective resource management, enforce zero tolerance for corruption, improve 
facilities, promote good leadership practices, and integrate vocational and technical 
education into the curriculum. These measures aim to equip students with skills for self
reliance, thereby reducing social crimes and enhancing societal stability.","/app/uploads/d629cd00e90b45aab94448412781ef5c.pdf","funai journal3.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:45:20.948838",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"

"9","ENGLISH LANGUAGE EDUCATION: THE PATHWAY TO  MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYABILITY","Olubukola A. Foyewa, Bethel N. Uzoma and Ifeoma Francisca Chukwuma Nwankwo","Language is an important factor in the life of any society. It consists of codes and 
arbitrary symbols through which any particular community communicate, interact and 
socialize. Language education is a means of communicating ideas, skills and expertise in 
a language to students or people through which they too, would express their skills, 
expertise and competence in the pursuit of their personal and national goals. English 
Language, a language that has been gaining great importance in global communication 
is fortunately, is the official and the language that is mostly used for instruction in the 
Nigeria educational sector. The paper discusses the use of English language education as 
the path to manpower development and its role in enhancing the employability status of

areas through workshops and identified some implications of the study on educational 
reforms in Nigeria.","/app/uploads/ea548587ac2f45e294e13a341d3a4398.pdf","funai journal6.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:54:10.378419",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"
"11","MANAGEMENT OF UNIVERSITY STAFF IN ECONOMIC  DEPRESSION: THE PRIMUS FOR ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE IN  REINVENTING THE WHEELS OF EDUCATION","Oluchi Queen Onwudinjo","Management of universities in the era of explosive digital technologies in all spheres of life 
involves systematic harmonization of all available resources of universities for enhancing 
performances, job satisfaction and high goals actualization.  Unfortunately, in Nigeria, many 
universities are presently managed under economic pressure, a difficult situation arising from 
inability of individuals/ groups to meet up with financial requirements for survival and up-keeps. 
These resulted in low teachers’ morale, ineffectiveness in teaching, poor learning and poor 
academic performances by both teachers and students. Also, language of learning in modern
day-universities, the workers, attaining excellence and maintenance are under threat of 
economic pressure, especially in this period of re-inventing the wheels of education. The 
economic pressure with its depressions has compelled communities and universities to diversify 
modalities to alleviate the existing challenges that made maximizing learning outcomes and 
attaining one’s potentials to be difficult. Despite numerous related efforts made by previous 
researchers in finding lasting solution to these ravaging problems, there seems nothing has been 
done in that regards. Until the ‘primus’ is done in the universities, achieving the targets cannot 
be possible. Re-inventing the wheels of education which means bringing forth or reinstituting the 
acceleration set-base for education, it is pertinent to understand that primus in management of 
university staff in economic depression for academic excellence is seeing the staff as human 
beings. Recommendations and conclusion among others were that the university staff should be 
paid their commensurate salaries duly, render all their staff welfares services, etc by the leaders. 
If not, achieving the university-aspirations of high quality academic excellence with other goals, 
can only be a mirage","/app/uploads/2b9aa6a33acd47ec93e019ffff0aa2fb.pdf","funai journal7.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:55:35.645567",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"
"12","SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS  (STM) EDUCATION AND THE ISSUE OF DEFENCE, SECURITY AND  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: AN AFRICAN PERSPECTIVE","Tajudeen Alani Williams","In Africa, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is 
becoming more and more important for the continent's growth, especially when it comes 
to issues of defense, security, and sustainable development. This paper provides insights 
into present initiatives, obstacles, and future potential by examining the interaction of 
STEM education with these important issues from an African perspective. There has been 
consensus among those in charge of security and sustainable development actors that 
security is one of the most important factors for sustainable development since it 
determines the levels of internal and external investments and the development a country 
can achieve and sustain. The theory of defense innovation and punctuated equilibrium 
framework were discussed since it is a network of organizations and institutions that 
interact to pursue science, technology and innovation-related activities to further the 
development of defense interests and capabilities. They also allow changes in planning, 
budgeting, research, development and other business processes which are necessary for 
sustainable development. Therefore, STEM is the bedrock for required defense which 
leads to the attainment of the necessary security and consequently a sustainable 
development. The use of defense innovation systems framework was recommended, 
adapting the Chinese quantum innovation ecosystem which creates educational 
programme reforms especially in STEM with special priority for mathematics as a base 
for modern science and technology necessary for sustainable development. Also 
recommended is the regional reform that concerns the neighbouring states with similar 
security and developmental challenges.","/app/uploads/43b2f5027388436dac894429b37bfbb6.pdf","funai journal8.pdf",,"2025-12-09 17:56:44.191747",,,"AE-FUNAI JOURNAL OF EDUCATION VOL 3, NO. 1 (2024)"
